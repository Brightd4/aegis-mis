# AEGIS-MIS

**AEGIS-MIS (Automated Explainable Guard for Information Security – Misinformation Identification System)**  
is a text-first AI system for identifying, categorizing, and explaining misinformation and security-related threats in digital content.

---

## Overview

AEGIS-MIS is designed to detect and analyze harmful information patterns such as:
- Misinformation and disinformation
- Phishing and scam content
- Coordinated influence or manipulation attempts

The system emphasizes **explainability**, **human oversight**, and **public-interest deployment**, making it suitable for research, policy support, and security analysis.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of AEGIS-MIS is to strengthen:
- Digital security
- Public information integrity
- Societal and institutional resilience

It enables early identification of harmful content patterns while supporting **analyst-in-the-loop** decision-making rather than fully automated enforcement.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Text-based misinformation detection
- Threat category classification (misinformation, phishing, scam, benign)
- Confidence scoring and risk assessment
- Explainable AI outputs (why content was flagged)
- Analyst review and validation support
- Modular, open-source system architecture

---

## Development Status

🚧 **Active Development**

This repository is currently in the research and prototype phase.  
Initial focus areas include:
- Text ingestion pipeline
- Threat classification models
- Transparent scoring logic
- Reproducible evaluation workflows

---

## Intended Use

AEGIS-MIS is intended for:
- Research and academic study
- Open-source collaboration
- Public-interest technology development
- Security and policy analysis use cases

It is **not** intended for mass surveillance or automated censorship.
