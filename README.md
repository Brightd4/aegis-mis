**AEGIS-MIS (Automated Explainable Guard for Information Security – Misinformation Identification System)** is a hybrid AI-assisted misinformation detection platform designed to support information integrity, cybersecurity awareness, and public-interest defense.

# Abstract

AEGIS-MIS (Automated Explainable Guard for Information Security – Misinformation Identification System) is a hybrid misinformation detection prototype designed to identify potentially deceptive or manipulative textual content.

The system combines rule-based pattern detection with a machine learning classifier based on TF-IDF feature extraction and logistic regression. These components are integrated through a hybrid scoring engine that produces a unified misinformation risk score.

To support transparency and interpretability, AEGIS-MIS includes an explainability module that highlights the triggers and model signals contributing to each decision. The system is deployed through a lightweight Flask web interface and REST API, enabling interactive analysis and integration with other security tools.

.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

---

# Run the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open:

```

# API Usage

Endpoint:

```
POST /api/analyze
```

Example PowerShell request:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod `
-Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/analyze" `
-Method Post `
-ContentType "application/json" `
-Body '{"text":"This is a secret cure they do not want you to know."}'
```

# Current Evaluation

Using the current prototype dataset and a stratified train/test split, the baseline Logistic Regression + TF-IDF classifier achieved:

- Accuracy: 1.000
- Precision: 1.000
- Recall: 1.000
- F1 Score: 1.000

### Important Note

These results were obtained on a small synthetic prototype dataset and should be interpreted as an early validation signal rather than final real-world performance. Broader evaluation on larger and more diverse datasets is planned.

# Purpose

AEGIS-MIS is a hybrid misinformation detection and security defense prototype that combines transparent rule-based logic with machine learning-assisted text classification.

---

# Future Work

The current prototype demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid rule-based and machine learning approaches for misinformation detection. Future improvements may include:

- Expanding the training dataset with real-world misinformation corpora
- Integrating transformer-based NLP models such as BERT or RoBERTa
- Implementing automated feature importance explanations
- Adding credibility scoring for external sources
- Building a browser extension for real-time misinformation detection
- Deploying the system as a scalable cloud service
- Enhancing multilingual misinformation detection capabilities
